# odin-recipes

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! ðŸŽ‰ This is a beginner-level web development project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) designed to sharpen my foundational HTML and CSS skills. The site features a simple recipe page layout, including an index page with links to individual recipes, each with structured content like descriptions, ingredients, and preparation steps.

## What I've Practiced So Far

- Structuring content with semantic HTML elements (`<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<img>`, `<a>`, etc.)
- Linking between pages using relative paths
- Organizing files into clean directories for maintainability
- Applying basic CSS styling to enhance readability and visual presentation

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated:

- Competency in writing clean and well-structured HTML
- Familiarity with CSS for styling text, layout, and page elements
- Ability to set up and manage a GitHub repository using Git workflow (`git clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`)
- Navigating and building basic web pages that could be hosted via GitHub Pages

## Reflection

This project helped me reinforce the importance of semantic structure, consistent naming conventions, and the beauty of keeping things simple when starting out. I look forward to revisiting it with more advanced styling as I continue learning.
